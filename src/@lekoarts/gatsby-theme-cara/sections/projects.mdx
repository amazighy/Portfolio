For the first project, I developed a dashboard to visualize the confirmed COVID-19 dearths.  When the page loads the user sees a world choropleth map of COVID-19 deaths. Upon clicks, the viewer sees a line and bar charts for COVID-19 details in that particular region

For the second project, I attempted to visualize global CO2 emission. I developed the second project combining D3.JS and ReactJS. These two technologies proved to be a good combination, as they allow for efficient reusability.
