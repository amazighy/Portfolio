Learning D3 turned out to be one of the greatest decisions I have made in a while. While there is much more to learn the course has given me some solid foundations. To complete the course requirements I have developed two projects. Although the two different projects meant to have a different emphasis i.e., Interactive and narrative, I focused on learning the technical aspects of D3 visualization in both my projects. The goal was to familiarize myself with as many visualizations as possible, hence the charts I used might not be the best way to visualize the topics I tried to address. For the first project, I developed a dashboard to visualize the confirmed COVID-19 dearths.  When the page loads the user sees a world choropleth map of COVID-19 deaths. Upon clicks, the viewer sees a line and bar charts for COVID-19 details in that particular region.  For the second project, I attempted to visualize global CO2 emission. I developed the second project combining D3.JS and ReactJS. These two technologies proved to be a good combination, as they allow for efficient code reusability.

The final goal of any visualization is to carry out a message. For it, the best way to convey a message is to use tools that could be understood by everyone.  Most often I see complex (fancy) visualization to explain something that can easily be explained by a simple bar chart. We often assume that the “target audience” knows how to interpret those visualizations. With all the privileges I have to be studying interactive visualizations, at a university, I still don’t know how to interpret some of them. While they are pleasing to the eye, for me the goal of interactive visuals is to allow people easy access to the data being presented. In other words, give people the ability to analyze the data themselves without having to use a spreadsheet or any data analysis tools.

Visuals are effective ways of presenting research findings, they can also be used to minimize our own biases. They could give the reader the ability to come to his or her own conclusion of our research. I don’t know about you, but I'm biased and I know it. I have always been concerned about my bias when presenting my research and disliked writing conclusion as I believe there isn’t just one conclusion. When deciding on what visuals to use to present my finding I tend to choose the simplest visuals that would allow the user to have full access to my data. Put differently, I use the visuals that allow the users to query the data the most with writing as little text as possible to limit my bias.

By far the most important thing I learned from the projects –learned it the hard way—is to constantly verifying that your progress is saved.  I had to redevelop project two entirely as  I forget to push my changes to GitHub. Additionally,  I learned to look around and do some research about the visualization I intend to use before starting to code them. Basically, to not have to reinvent the wheels unless I have to. Furthermore, it is time-consuming to develop even the simple bar chat thus developing reusable code could save you a lot of time in the future.

The critique sessions were the most valuable in various ways. Most Importantly, they were very stimulating intellectually. They were a reminder to myself that the most important thing is not to code the most complex visualization, but to convey a message or research findings. They offered a moment of encouragement, support as well as invaluable feedback.

For the first project even though I haven’t put down a prospectus outline, I was able to code it almost exactly the way I conceived. For the second project, however, I did not write down a prospectus nor any conceptualization of what I wanted to make. Even though the purpose was to learn how to make visualization, not having a prospectus resulted in a huge loss of time. For future visualization I would certainly make sure to put down a detailed prospectus.
